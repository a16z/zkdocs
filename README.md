# zkDocs

*Insert version of blog intro for context*

zkDocs improve privacy throughout information attestation and verification workflows using cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs. The goal of this repo is to demo these technologies and make them trivial to use via schema to SNARK circuit transpilation.

## Repo structure
- `./zkdocs-backend` – the transpiler, circuits, contracts, and tests
- `./zkdocs-ui` – a sample react client which renders schemas and interacts with contracts
- `./zkdocs-lib` – code shared by the other workspaces

## How This Works
Three relevant actors interact with zkDocs throughout the process:
- **Verifier**: The admin or creator of a zk-doc schema (ex: creditor / mortgage lender)
- **Submitter**: An individual or individuals seeking to be verified by the schema (ex: mortgage seeker)
- **Attestor**: Someone that can attest to some of the submitters fields (ex: employer / home appraiser)

First, a verifier creates a schema. 

The schema is a json of the format:
```
{
    fields: [...field info...],
    constraints: [...aggregations over fields...],
    trusted_institutions: [...set of attestors...]
}
```

From the schema the library transpiles a zero-knowledge circuit. Now the verifier can deploy the zkDoc smart contract and associated PLONK verifier contract EVM-based chain.

Submitters can then connect a client (like `./zkdocs-ui`) and submit some *commitments* to the fields. These commitments are computed as `hash(value, nonce)` for each field in the schema. Commitments are a cryptographic scheme with two important properties:
- One way: probabalistically near impossible to reverse the value from the commitment to the value
- Collision resistant: probabalistically near impossible that a submitter can post a commitment and later find another `(value, nonce)` combination hashing to the same commitment

As a result, a submitter cannot change their inputs after broadcasting the commitment, but has also not revealed any information about their underlying values.

Once the submitter has posted their commitments, they can send the relevant `(value, nonce)` tuples to each of their attestors. The attestor can compute `hash(value, nonce)` locally and confirm that the commitment matches what was initially broadcast. Then the attestor can confirm that the value of the field is true based on whatever privileged information they have access to (like an employer verifying a individual's salary). No other participants have access to the value underlying the commitment, yet all participants can confirm each field has received an attestation. We do assume that the privileged actors do not leak the `(value, nonce)` to other parties. In this context, we use Ethereum native public key cryptography to ensure authenticity of attestor and to broadcast commitments. 

Finally the submitter can generate a zero-knowledge proof: `proof(values, nonces, commitments)`. The proof confirms that the values/nonces underlying the commitment have not changed and verifies that all fields satisfy schema constraints (such as the sum of the fields is below a threshold), without revealing any of the values to the verifier.

Combining on-chain attestations and the zero-knowledge proof, a verifier can be sure that the schema has been filled out truthfully without knowledge of the underlying fields. Of course, the submitter could also "decrypt" any of the commitments to any verifying party at any time by providing the corresponding `(value, nonce)`.

More specific details are available in `./zkdocs-backend/README.md`.

## zkDocs Client
The `zkdocs-ui` client is a sample react client which renders arbitrary schemas and demos workflows for the three actors mentioned above. 

Submitters can fill out schema fields and post commitments to chain. The UI will generate attestation links for each attestor, which include decryption keys for each field. Additionally submitters can generate their zk-proof that the underlying fields are valid.

Attestors can open these links (with a connected wallet) in the client. The client will verify that the schema stored locally matches the on-chain contract. It will then verify that each `(value, nonce)` hash they've been provided by the submitter matches the commitment on-chain. Finally, they can send a transaction attesting to each commitment.

Any third party verifier can view the state of the document submission process for any user without knowledge of any of the underlying fields.
